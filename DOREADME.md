## Murder and DNA make up
A serial killer can be different then a normal human in different ways in the mind like one test fallon did on his family to find genes associated to violence which led to the discovery of MAO-A gene i.e. a gene that produces the monoamine oxidase A enzyme. The MAO-A gene is also known as the ‘warrior gene’ and regulates levels of the mood hormone, serotonin, in the brain.Fallon’s most important finding was that a low level of activity in the brain’s orbital cortex is found in those with sociopathic tendencies, making it difficult for them to suppress impulses of rage, violence, hunger or sexual desire.
